# LIVEwallpaper
 I called this application is a LIVE Wallpaper.
 Your desktop wallpaper will change with time. 
 After launching, you need to click on the icon in the tray
 and enter your date of birth
 and how long you are going to live
 (the app has a map with the life expectancy of the world).
 After that, add the app to the startup and every day you will see your progress.
